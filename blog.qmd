These posts have evolved from my digital garden[^1] into a bit longer form.
Their main role is [to educate myself](https://rgiordan.github.io/meta/2019/07/26/why.html) and they may be incomplete, written from a very subjective point of view, or contain errors.
I'd be grateful for feedback on how to improve them!

[^1]: See [this link](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/) for a difference. I maintain my digital garden in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Please, let me know if you know a good way of integrating Obsidian with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)!
