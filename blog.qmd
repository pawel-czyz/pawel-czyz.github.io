The following posts have evolved from my digital garden[^1] into a bit longer form.
Note that these posts may be incomplete, written from a subjective point of view or contain errors.
I'd be grateful for feedback on how to improve them.

[^1]: See [this post](https://github.com/pawel-czyz/channel-capacity-estimator) for a difference. If you know how to integrate [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) together with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), I'd very interested to hear.
