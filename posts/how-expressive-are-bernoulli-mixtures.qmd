We have [already discussed](beta-bernoulli.qmd) that all the distributions with only two outcomes are Bernoulli distributions.
Similarly, a distribution on a finite set has to be a categorical distribution (so, if it has the full support, it has to be in an [exponential family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family)).

Let's now think about the probability distributions on the space of binary vectors, $\mathcal Y = \{0, 1\}^G$. The most general case is the categorical distribution mentioned above, which requires specifying a probability table with $2^G$ entries (with $2^G-1$ free parameters).
On the other hand, we can consider a distribution with $G$ parameters, which corresponds to $G$ independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) Bernoulli trials:
