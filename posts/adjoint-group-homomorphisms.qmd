Consider a group $G$.
Its [delooping](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group#delooping) is a one-object category, $\mathbf{B}G$, such that it has a single object $\bullet_G$ and each $g\in G$ is treated as a morphism $\bullet_G \to \bullet_G$.
The morphism composition is then the usual group composition.
A group homomorphism $f\colon G\to H$ is then essentially the same as a functor $\mathbf{B}f\colon \mathbf{B}G\to \mathbf{B}G$ (with the difference that the functor $\mathbf{B}f$ additionally maps the object $\bullet_G$ to the object $\bullet_H$).

Consider now two group homomorphisms, $f\colon G\to H$ and $u\colon H\to G$.
If we treat them as functors, $\mathbf{B}f$ and $\mathbf{B}u$, under which circumstances are they [adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors)?
In other words, what are the properties of homomorphisms of $f$ and $u$, such that $\mathbf{B}f \dashv \mathbf{B}u$?

For an adjunction we need a natural isomorphism $\psi_{\bullet_G\bullet_H}\colon \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{B}H}( \mathbf{B}f(\bullet_G), \bullet_H) \to \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{B}G}(\bullet_G, \mathbf{B}g(\bullet_H) )$.This is just a convoluted way of writing that we need a bijection $\psi\colon H\to G$ with additional properties, making it the *natural* isomorphism.

What properties?
Let's introduce some notation. For an arrow $h\in H$ we write $h^\flat = \psi(h)$.
If $\phi\colon G\to H$ be the inverse, $\phi = \psi^{-1}$, and $g\in G$, we write $g^\sharp = \phi(g)$.
Of course, we have $(h^\flat)^\sharp = h$ and $(g^\sharp)^\flat = g$ for all $h$ and $g$.

The first property (naturality in $\mathbf{B}H$) reads that for every $h_1$ and $h_2$ in $H$, we have
$$
    u(h_1) h_2^\flat = (h_1h_2)^\flat,
$$
or equivalently,
$$
  u(h_1) \psi(h_2) = \psi(h_1h_2).  
$$

The second property (naturality in $\mathbf{B}G$) reads that for every $g\in G$ and $h \in H$ it holds that
$$
    (h \circ f(g))^\flat = h^\flat g.
$$

This looks asymmetric, but we can fix it. As $G$ and $H$ have to be bijections, we can write $h = g_1^\sharp$. Rename $g$ to $g_2$. Then,
$$
    (g_1^\sharp f(g_2))^\flat = g_1 g_2,
$$

or equivalently
$$
    g_1^\sharp f(g_2) = (g_1 g_2)^\sharp,
$$

or equivalently
$$
    \phi(g_1) f(g_2) = \phi(g_1g_2).
$$

To summarise, we require
$$
    \phi(g_1)f(g_2) = \phi(g_1 g_2), \quad u(h_1) \psi(h_2) = \psi(h_1 h_2).
$$

for all $g_1, g_2\in G$ and $h_1, h_2 \in H$.
Note that these conditions *differ from* the definition of a homomorphism, having $f(g_2)$ instead of $\phi(g_2)$ and $u(h_1)$ instead of $\psi(h_1)$.
They are also slightly asymmetric, which is related to the fact that adjoint functors also have this asymmetry: we want $f$ to be the left adjoint and $g$ to be the right adjoint. 


These conditions are, actually, very restrictive: if we take $g_1 = 1_G$, the identity element, then we have
$$
    \phi(1_G) f(g) = \phi(g)
$$

for all $g\in G$.
We can therefore write $f$ as a composition of bijective functions, i.e., $f$ is also bijective.
And as $f$ is a bijective group homomorphism, it has to be a group isomorphism.

We can now conjecture the following:

**Theorem:** Let $f\colon G \leftrightarrows H \colon u$ be two group homomorphisms. They form an adjoint pair if and only if they are group isomorphisms (not necessarily inverse to each other).

*Proof:* Assume first that $f$ and $u$ are adjoint.
Using the same notation as above, we see that $f$ is a group isomorphism.
Analogously,
$$
    u(h) \psi(1_H) = \psi(h)
$$

for all $h\in H$, so that $u$ is an isomorphism.


Conversely, assume that $f$ and $u$ are any group isomorphisms.
Choose any $g'\in G$ and $h'\in H$ and define $\phi(g) = h' f(g)$ and $\psi(h) = u(h) g'$.

We have
$$
\begin{align*}
    \phi(g_1) f(g_2) &= h' f(g_1) f(g_2) &&= h' f(g_1g_2) &= \phi(g_1g_2)\\
    u(h_1)\psi(h_2) &= u(h_1) u(h_2) g' &&= u(h_1h_2) g' &= \psi(h_1h_2).
\end{align*}
$$

At this point we see that the only examples of adjoint group homomorphisms arise from group isomorphisms.

## Where are the monads?

As we have an adjunction $\mathbf{B}f\dashv \mathbf{B}u$ for any pair of group isomorphisms $f$ and $u$, we can take a look how monads work.
Let's start by recalling the definitions of the unit and counit.

The unit is a natural transformation $\eta\colon 1_{\mathbf{B}G}\Rightarrow \mathbf{B}uf$ given by $\eta_{\bullet_G} = (1_H)^\flat$.
Abusing the notation to write $\eta$ instead of $\eta_{\bullet_G}$, we see that $\eta = \psi(1_H) = u(1_H)g' = 1_Gg' = g'$
from the proof above.

**TODO: WHY IS IT A NATURAL ISOMORPHISM?**

What is the counit? Analogously, it is $\epsilon = (1_G)^\sharp = h'$ from the proof above.

Pytania:

  - Czy mając zadane sprzężenie $f$ i $u$ może być więcej niż jedna para bijekcji $\psi = \phi^{-1}$  spełniających aksjomaty?
  - Czy mając zadane $f$, ,,prawe sprzężenie'' $u$ jest unikalne?
